Executive Summary

Swamp is a media marketplace made by San Francisco State University
students for other SFSU community members that offers trade and
exchanging of media. Developed by gators, the creators of Swamp found that
currently there is not a multimedia marketplace that caters only to SFSU
students and faculty. Using modern software web application technology, our
team is able to ensure quick, easy and reliable use of our product so that our
users can have exclusive access to a reliable resource of media assets for
academic or extracurricular usage.

Swamp offers a fluid user experience that is user-friendly for the SFSU
community members that may be familiar or unfamiliar with web application
usage, while also offering features that tailor to needs of the student body
and SFSU faculty. Our search system offers a feature allowing for students to
filter listings posted by area of study. Upon entering the site, users are able to
browse the site’s marketplace. Once an unregistered user commits to a
transaction, they will be prompted to register ensuring that the buying and
selling feature is exclusive to registered users. Admin acts as a filter for
content by approving or denying user listings so that all visible content is
maintained to be appropriate.

Swamp’s team is composed of upper division San Francisco State
University computer science students and operates out of San Francisco.
Each team member adds a unique perspective to the Swamp product while
being able to effectively work as a team in order to create a product that
delivers an efficient exchange of media between SFSU community members.
Since Swamp is created by students, our team is able to shape the product
toward the needs of the demographic we are serving.
